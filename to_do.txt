- Create Signup Form (using UserCreationForm) and customize fields labels
- connect django-bootstrap to make forms looks nicer (bootstrap_form)
- inject part of html into a page (they will be store in files with format: _file.html) via "include" tag
- pip install misaka (for embeded urls)
- use slugify in models
- posts Meta: ordering (by newest), unique_together constraint (message, user) - not sure why this needed?
- use tabularinline to show items in admin panel
